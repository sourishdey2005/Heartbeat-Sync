It’s in the way you know my coffee order, the way you look at me when you think I’m not watching, and the steady, unwavering rhythm of your presence in my life.\n\nYou are my safe harbor in a chaotic sea. You are the light that filters through the trees on a long afternoon. More than anything, you are the person I want to share every heartbeat with, today and for all the Februaries yet to come.\n\nThank you for being the other half of this sync.",
